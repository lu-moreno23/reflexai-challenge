### Hello Reflex AI team!
It's been wonderful to be able to do this challenge, I've learnt a lot by doing it so no matter the outcome, I just wanted to say "Thanks!"

# Please in order to run this project:
1- Make sure you have cypress installed or after cloning the repo just run 
`npm install cypress --save-dev`

2- You'll also need DayJS since I've used to validate months on a tooltip, in order to install it just run
`npm install dayjs --save`

3- To run cypress simple do
`npm run cypress:open`

General considerations
Please note that I've tried to cover basic functionalities, extra required test cases have been listed on a manual testplan
